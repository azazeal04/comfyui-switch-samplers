# ComfyUI Switch Samplers Pack

This custom node pack for **[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)** introduces advanced sampler and scheduler switching strategies. It allows users to dynamically change samplers, schedulers, models, VAEs, CFG scales, denoise values, and conditioning between stages of a generation.

The pack is designed for both **same-family checkpoints** (e.g. SDXL variants).

## ‚ú® Features

* **2+ Fully Working Sampler Nodes**

  * Step Switch KSampler

  * MultiStep KSampler

* **Upgraded Cross-Model Nodes**
Still to be added when tests are completed.

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone or download this repository into your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` folder:

   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
   git clone https://github.com/azazeal04/comfyui-switch-samplers.git
   ```

   Or manually place the folder inside `ComfyUI/custom_nodes`.

2. Restart ComfyUI.

3. The new nodes will appear under:

   * **Azazeal / Switch Samplers** (all original switching nodes)
   
---

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

* Connect a **Model**, **VAE**, **Conditioning** (positive/negative), and **Latent Image** into one of the switch nodes.
* Select samplers, schedulers, step counts, CFG values, and denoise levels per stage.
* Outputs a new **LATENT** tensor for further processing or decoding.

---

## ‚ö° Example Workflows

* **StepSwitchKSampler**
  Run first 10 steps with Euler on SDXL, then switch to 10 steps with DPM++ 2M Karras for refinement.

* **MultiStepKSampler**
  Run 3 consecutive sampler stages with different samplers, schedulers, and denoise values.
